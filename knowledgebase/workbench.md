Ah, you want to do a **screen mode change** to 320x256 like games do! Yes, absolutely - that's actually the more traditional approach for AmigaOS applications that need specific resolutions.

## Custom Screen Approach

You'll want to open a custom screen at 320x256 resolution:

```c
struct TagItem screen_tags[] = {
    SA_Width, 320,
    SA_Height, 256,
    SA_Depth, 8,                    // Or whatever depth you need
    SA_DisplayID, LORES_KEY,        // Low-res PAL/NTSC mode
    SA_Title, NULL,                 // No screen title
    SA_Quiet, TRUE,                 // No screen depth gadget
    SA_ShowTitle, FALSE,            // Hide screen title bar
    TAG_END
};

struct Screen *display_screen = OpenScreenTagList(NULL, screen_tags);
```

## Window on Custom Screen

Then open your window on this custom screen:

```c
struct TagItem window_tags[] = {
    WA_CustomScreen, display_screen,
    WA_Left, 0,
    WA_Top, 0, 
    WA_Width, 320,
    WA_Height, 256,
    WA_Borderless, TRUE,
    WA_Backdrop, TRUE,
    WA_Activate, TRUE,
    WA_IDCMP, IDCMP_RAWKEY | IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS,
    TAG_END
};
```

## Benefits of This Approach:

- **True fullscreen**: The entire display changes to 320x256
- **Hardware scrolling**: If needed, you can scroll larger virtual screens
- **Better performance**: Direct access to display memory
- **Game-like experience**: Exactly like how games handle resolution changes
- **Copper lists**: Access to hardware features if needed

## Return to Workbench:

When ESC is pressed:
1. Close the window
2. Close the custom screen with `CloseScreen(display_screen)`
3. The system automatically returns to the Workbench screen
4. Your MUI application regains focus

This is definitely the more "Amiga-like" way to do fullscreen display modes, especially for graphics-intensive applications or games. The screen mode change gives you complete control over the display hardware.

Perfect! If you already have your custom palette, ImageMagick's `-remap` is exactly what you need:

```bash
convert input.png -remap your_palette.png output.png
```

That's it! ImageMagick will remap all the colors in your input image to the closest matching colors in your palette.

**A few useful variations:**
```bash
# With dithering (usually gives better results)
convert input.png -dither Floyd-Steinberg -remap your_palette.png output.png

# Different dithering methods
convert input.png -dither Riemersma -remap your_palette.png output.png

# Without dithering (harder color boundaries)
convert input.png +dither -remap your_palette.png output.png
```

**Palette format notes:**
- Your palette can be any image format (PNG, GIF, etc.)
- ImageMagick will extract the unique colors from your palette image
- The palette image doesn't need to be arranged in any special way - it just needs to contain the colors you want

The `-remap` function works quite well and will handle the color matching in whatever colorspace you're working with. It's very straightforward once you have your custom palette ready!

For AGA development, either approach works technicallyâ€”but **reserving UI-specific colours at the start of the palette** tends to be more practical and maintainable. Here's why:

---

### ðŸ§  Why Start-of-Palette Is Preferable

#### âœ… Easier Indexing
- UI elements often use fixed color indices (e.g. borders, text, icons).
- If you reserve indices 0â€“31 for UI, you can hardcode references like `pen = 5` without worrying about dynamic remapping.

#### ðŸ§° Cleaner Asset Management
- Sprites and backgrounds can use the remaining indices (e.g. 32â€“255), allowing you to swap or fade them without affecting UI.
- If you ever implement palette cycling or fade effects, you can exclude the first 32 entries to keep UI stable.

#### ðŸ“œ Historical Precedent
- Many classic AGA demos and games reserved the first chunk of the palette for UI or system pens.
- It mirrors how Workbench reserved pens 0â€“7 for system colors.

### ðŸ§© Alternative: End-of-Palette

You *could* reserve UI colors at the end (e.g. 224â€“255), especially if you're building a dynamic palette system where sprite art is loaded first and UI is patched in later. But this adds complexity:

- Youâ€™ll need to offset all UI pen references
- Itâ€™s harder to enforce consistency across assets
- Some tools (like older editors) assume low indices for UI or text

### ðŸ”§ Suggested Layout

| Index Range | Purpose            |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 0â€“31        | UI pens (text, borders, icons) |
| 32â€“223      | Backgrounds, sprites, tiles     |
| 224â€“255     | Reserved for effects, transitions, or dynamic overlays |
