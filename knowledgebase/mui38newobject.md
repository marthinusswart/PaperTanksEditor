# Safe Object Creation in MUI 3.8 (`mui38newobject.md`)

## 🧠 Overview

This document outlines the correct and incorrect ways to instantiate GUI objects in Magic User Interface (MUI) 3.8, particularly focusing on the differences between `NewObject()` and `MUI_NewObject()`. It is based on real-world testing and debugging within WinUAE using AmigaOS 3.1 and MUI 3.8.

---

## ❌ Failed Attempts (For Future Reference)

### 1. Direct `NewObject()` Outside Layout

````c
Object *testRect = NewObject(MUIC_Rectangle, NULL,
    MUIA_Width, 100,
    MUIA_Height, 50,
    MUIA_Background, MUII_ButtonBack,
TAG_END);

Outcome:
Crashes WinUAE immediately, even with muimaster.library successfully opened.
Reason:
NewObject() performs immediate instantiation. GUI classes like MUIC_Rectangle and MUIC_Text expect to be created within a valid layout context (e.g. inside a WindowObject or ApplicationObject). Without this context, internal MUI state is uninitialized, leading to memory access violations.

```C
Child, NewObject(MUIC_Rectangle, NULL,
    MUIA_Width, 100,
    MUIA_Height, 50,
    MUIA_Background, MUII_ButtonBack,
TAG_END),
````

Outcome:
Still crashes UAE.
Reason:
Even though the call is nested inside a layout, NewObject() is evaluated immediately during parsing. MUI expects buffered tag lists and deferred instantiation, which NewObject() does not provide.

✅ Successful Approach
Using MUI_NewObject() Procedurally

```C
Object *testRect = MUI_NewObject(MUIC_Rectangle, NULL,
    MUIA_Width, 100,
    MUIA_Height, 50,
    MUIA_Background, MUII_ButtonBack,
TAG_END);

if (testRect) {
    fileLoggerAddEntry("SUCCESS: Rectangle created!");
    DisposeObject(testRect);
}
```

Outcome:
Works perfectly. No crashes. Object is created and disposed safely.
Why It Works:
MUI_NewObject() wraps NewObject() with internal buffering and layout awareness. It ensures that GUI objects are instantiated only when the layout engine is ready, avoiding premature evaluation and unsafe memory access.

Using Macro-Based Layouts

```C
Child, RectangleObject,
    MUIA_Width, 100,
    MUIA_Height, 50,
    MUIA_Background, MUII_ButtonBack,
End,
```

Outcome:
Stable and safe. Works inside ApplicationObject or WindowObject.
Why It Works:
Macros like RectangleObject, End defer instantiation and buffer tag lists internally. They are designed to be layout-safe and context-aware.

🔧 Recommended Strategy Going Forward
| Use Case | Recommended Constructor |
| Static layout definitions | RectangleObject, TextObject, etc. |
| Procedural object creation | MUI_NewObject() |
| Low-level or custom classes | NewObject() (only if layout-safe and context-aware) |

🧪 Debugging Tips

- Always ensure MUIMasterBase = OpenLibrary("muimaster.library", 0) succeeds before creating any MUI objects.
- Use SnoopDOS or UAE serial logging to catch class load failures or tag parsing errors.
- If testing standalone objects, prefer MUI_NewObject() even for basic classes like MUIC_Text.

🧠 Conclusion
MUI 3.8 object creation requires careful attention to context. While NewObject() may seem straightforward, it lacks the safeguards needed for GUI classes. Always prefer MUI_NewObject() or macro-based layouts to ensure stability, especially when working within emulated environments like WinUAE.
This approach not only prevents crashes but aligns with best practices from MorphOS and official MUI documentation.

# 🧵 MUI 3.8 Class Registration & `cl_ID` Handling on AmigaOS 3.x

## ❌ Why `RegisterClass()` Crashes

- `muimaster.library` on AmigaOS 3.x is a **flat library**.
- It does **not expose** an interface with function pointers like `RegisterClass()`.
- Casting `MUIMasterBase` to a struct with function pointers leads to **undefined behavior** and **crashes**.

```C
struct MUIMasterIFace *MUIMaster = (struct MUIMasterIFace *)MUIMasterBase;

if (MUIMaster && MUIMaster->RegisterClass)
{
    MUIMaster->RegisterClass("PTEImagePanel.mcc", PTEImagePanelClass->mcc_Class); // ❌ Crashes
}
```

---

## ✅ Safe Instantiation in MUI 3.8

Use pointer-based instantiation via `cl_ID`:

```C
Object *obj = MUI_NewObject(PTEImagePanelClass->mcc_Class->cl_ID, ...);
```

This works because MUI uses the pointer, not the name string.

---

## 🧪 Assigning `cl_ID` for Logging

You can safely assign a name to `cl_ID` **after** class creation:

```C
PTEImagePanelClass = MUI_CreateCustomClass(...);
PTEImagePanelClass->mcc_Class->cl_ID = (STRPTR)"PTEImagePanel.mcc"; // ✅ Safe for logging
```

This does **not** register the class name — it’s purely cosmetic.

---

## ❌ Name-Based Instantiation Is Unsupported

This will **fail** unless the class was registered by name (which MUI 3.8 doesn’t support):

```C
Object *obj = MUI_NewObject("PTEImagePanel.mcc", ...); // ❌ Will fail
```

---

## 🛠️ Optional Workaround: Manual Registry

You can build a simple name-to-class registry:

```C
static struct {
    STRPTR name;
    Class *classPtr;
} classRegistry[] = {
    { "PTEImagePanel.mcc", PTEImagePanelClass->mcc_Class },
    { NULL, NULL }
};

Class *FindClassByName(STRPTR name) {
    for (int i = 0; classRegistry[i].name; i++) {
        if (strcmp(classRegistry[i].name, name) == 0)
            return classRegistry[i].classPtr;
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

Then wrap instantiation:

```C
Object *MUI_NewObjectByName(STRPTR name, ...) {
    Class *cls = FindClassByName(name);
    return cls ? MUI_NewObject(cls->cl_ID, ...) : NULL;
}
```

## ✅ Safe Timing for `cl_ID` Assignment

| Timing                                                       | Safe to change `cl_ID`? | Notes                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| After `MUI_CreateCustomClass()` but before `MUI_NewObject()` | ✅ Yes                  | Ideal time                |
| After `MUI_NewObject()`                                      | ✅ Yes                  | Safe if not reused        |
| Before `MUI_CreateCustomClass()`                             | ❌ No                   | `mcc_Class` not valid yet |
| If using name-based instantiation                            | ❌ No                   | Will break lookup         |

---

## 🔮 MorphOS/OS4 Support

On MorphOS or AmigaOS 4, you can use `RegisterClass()` via interface:

```C
MUIMasterIFace = (struct MUIMasterIFace *)GetInterface(MUIMasterBase, "main", 1, NULL);
MUIMasterIFace->RegisterClass("PTEImagePanel.mcc", PTEImagePanelClass->mcc_Class); // ✅ Only on MorphOS/OS4
```

Not available on AmigaOS 3.x.
